## The MVC test app 
It stays in that place where a marathon of the challenge was done. Not working rendering views and routes and maybe some think more (Not tests not truth).

The app based on pure PHP and MVC pattern. 

## For fast run of app use script ``run.sh``. 
It will creates all necessary dependencies and server requirements.

## Server requirements
- PHP 7.2
  - Additional extensions of php: 
    - pdo
    - pdo_mysql

- MySQL
