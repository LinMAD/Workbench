### Workbench

![workspace](workbranch.jpg)

The repository ~~is a collection~~ junk storage of different tinkered projects.
Like: small demos, mini-applications or even implemented challenge tasks. :thinking:

- **Why it's here?**

Because the project doesn't deserve own repository. 
It's mostly for me to keep tracks of my learning and progress.

But maybe someone can be inspired, take the same courses or practical assignments to make self better. :muscle:*

Anyway `Happy coding` and `never stop learning`!
